        <p>If audio content plays automatically for longer than 3 seconds, users must be able to pause or mute it.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            People who use screen readers might struggle to hear speech output when other audio is playing. Because screen reader volume is
            typically controlled by the overall system volume, users must be able to stop or mute the audio content independently.
        </p>
        <p>Audio that plays automatically can be distracting, especially to people with attention deficit disorders.</p>

        <h3>From a user's perspective</h3>
        <p>
            <Markup.Emphasis>
                "I use a screen reader and keyboard to operate software and enjoy content. Audio that plays automatically can interrupt the
                screen reader voice and break my concentration. Do not play audio automatically. If auto-playing audio is essential, provide
                me an immediate way to stop, pause, mute and control volume so I can focus on the task at hand."
            </Markup.Emphasis>
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <p>Implement one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Good: Provide a mechanism for users to pause, stop, or mute the audio content without affecting the overall system volume,
                or
            </li>
            <li>Better: Make the audio stop automatically after three seconds, or</li>
            <li>Best: Play the audio only on user request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The first two solutions are preferred, as audio content that plays automatically can make it difficult for a person using a
            screen reader to find a mechanism for controlling the audio.
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <p>When a web page opens, ambient music begins playing automatically. The music continues as long as the page is open.</p>
            }
            passText={
                <p>Music does not start automatically. The user can start the music by selecting a 'Play' button at the top of the page.</p>
            }
