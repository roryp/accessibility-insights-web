        <p>Pre-recorded multimedia content must have captions.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Captions provide visual access to information in the audio track, allowing people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch
            pre-recorded multimedia presentations. Captions are also helpful to non-native speakers and to people who have difficulty
            understanding auditory information.
        </p>

        <h3>From a user's perspective</h3>
        <p>
            <Markup.Emphasis>
                "I often work once everyone has gone to sleep, so I mute the audio and use captions to enjoy and work with content. Provide
                captions for any pre-recorded media so I can understand and enjoy content."
            </Markup.Emphasis>
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If captions are missing, add them.
                <ul>
                    <li>Use closed captions (visible on demand) if possible.</li>
                    <li>Use open captions (always visible) if your media player or hosting provider doesn't support closed captions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the captions provide an accurate and complete description of the audio content:
                <ul>
                    <li>Include all speech.</li>
                    <li>Identify the speakers.</li>
                    <li>Describe any other meaningful sounds.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example</h2>

        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <p>
                    The captions for a video recording of a play are based on the play’s script rather than its performance. Some dialog is
                    reported incorrectly, and sound effects and audience applause are omitted.
                </p>
            }
            passText={<p>The captions are revised to accurately and completely describe the play as performed.</p>}
        />
