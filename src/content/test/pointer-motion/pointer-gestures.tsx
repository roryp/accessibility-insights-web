        <p>Functions must be operable without requiring multipoint or path-based gestures.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Multipoint and path-based gestures can be difficult or impossible to execute for people who have limited fine motor control or
            who use head tracking, gaze tracking, or speech commands to control their mouse pointer. Moreover, many users might not be aware
            that such gestures are supported, especially if they have cognitive or learning disabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <p>
            For any function that can be operated using multipoint or path-based gestures, provide an alternative method that (1) requires
            only a single pointer, and (2) doesn't depend on the path of the pointer's movement.
        </p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <p>
                    An online survey requires respondents to rank the importance of certain list items by dragging and dropping them into
                    priority order. Dragging requires path-based input, and no alternative method is provided.
                </p>
            }
            passText={
                <p>
                    Respondents can reorder list items either by dragging them or by selecting <Markup.Term>Up</Markup.Term> and{' '}
                    <Markup.Term>Down</Markup.Term> buttons associated with each item. The buttons can be selected using touch, mouse, or
                    keyboard.
                </p>
            }
        />
