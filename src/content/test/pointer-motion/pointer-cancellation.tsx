        <p>Users must be able to cancel functions that can be operated using a single pointer.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone benefits when it's easy to recover from hitting the wrong mouse or touch target. People with motor, visual, or
            cognitive disabilities are more likely to inadvertently initiate mouse or touch events.
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <p>For any function that can be operated using a single pointer, make sure at least one of the following is true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The down event doesn't trigger any part of the function, or</li>
            <li>
                The down event initiates the function, which is completed only on the up event, and users can abort or undo the function, or
            </li>
            <li>The down event completes the function, and the up event reverses the outcome of the preceding down event.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <p>
                    An online survey allows respondents to rank the importance of certain list items by dragging and dropping them into
                    priority order. Once an item is selected (on the down event), the user has no way to cancel the drag operation. To avoid
                    moving the list item, the user must place it back in its original position before triggering the up event.
                </p>
            }
            passText={
                <p>
                    The user can cancel a drag operation by dropping the item (on the up event) with the pointer outside the boundaries of
                    the list.
                </p>
            }
        />
