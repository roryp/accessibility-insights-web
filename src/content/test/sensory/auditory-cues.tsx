        <p>Auditory cues must be accompanied by visual cues.</p>

        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>
            Auditory cues can help communicate system events to people with good hearing. However, auditory cues alone don't help people who
            are deaf or have a hearing loss, people who work in noisy environments, or people who mute their computer's audio to avoid
            disturbing others.
        </p>

        <h2>How to fix</h2>
        <p>For each auditory cue, also provide a visible cue.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <Markup.PassFail
            failText={
                <p>
                    An online quiz provides feedback when an answer is submitted by playing a 'ding' when the answer is correct and a 'buzz'
                    when it's incorrect (auditory only).
                </p>
            }
            passText={<p>In addition to playing audio, text is displayed on the screen (auditory + visual).</p>}
        />
