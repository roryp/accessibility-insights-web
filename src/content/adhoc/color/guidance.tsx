        <h2>Why color matters</h2>

        <p>
            When color is the only visual means of conveying meaning (such as communicating information, indicating an action, prompting a
            response, or distinguishing a visible element), that meaning is not available to people who are blind or colorblind. To ensure
            that meaning conveyed through color is available to everyone, it must also be conveyed through other visual aspects. (It must
            also be communicated textually to assistive technology, but that's beyond the scope of this test.)

        <h2>About the Color visualization</h2>

        <p>
            By showing the target page in grayscale, the Color visualization helps you identify instances where color is the only visible
            means of conveying meaning.

                    <li>Combine color with other visual aspects, such as shape, size, symbols, or text.</li>

                <h3>Don't offer instructions that rely solely on color or other sensory characteristics.</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Sensory characteristics include color, shape, size, visual location, orientation and sound.</li>
                    <li>
                        Incorporating text is the best way to ensure your instructions don't rely on sensory characteristics.
