      This page contains a summary that indicates the progress of your assessment. An assessment is a manual experience in which you navigate through a set of tests that cover all WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria. Each test has one or more requirements that can be:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automated
        </li>
        <li>
          Assisted
        </li>
        <li>
          Manual
        </li>
      </ul>
      Where possible, 
      Accessibility Insights for Web
       "assists" the test process by generating a list of instances to evaluate and highlighting them on the screen. 
      Accessibility Insights for Web
       also allows you to manually record failure instances.
