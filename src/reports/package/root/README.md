# accessibility-insights-report

Publish [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility scan results as 
self-contained HTML files in the same format as
[accessibility-insights-web](https://github.com/microsoft/accessibility-insights-web).

## Usage

Before using accessibility-insights-report, you will need to run an [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) accessibility scan to produce some axe results to convert. Typically, you would do this by using an axe integration library for your favorite browser automation tool ([axe-puppeteer](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-puppeteer), [axe-webdriverjs](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-webdriverjs), [cypress-axe](https://github.com/avanslaars/cypress-axe)).

accessibility-insights-report exports a factory that can be used to create a report object and output its results as HTML.

Use it like this:

```ts
import * as Axe from 'axe';
import * as AxePuppeteer from 'axe-puppeteer';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as Puppeteer from 'puppeteer'
import * as util from 'util';

import { reporterFactory } from "accessibility-insights-report";

test('my accessibility test', async () => {
    // This example uses axe-puppeteer, but you can use any axe-based library
    // that outputs axe scan results in the default axe output format
    const testPage: Puppeteer.Page = /* ... set up your test page ... */;
    const axeResults: Axe.AxeResults = await new AxePuppeteer(testPage).analyze();

    // Construct the reporter object from the factory
    const reporter = reporterFactory();

    // Perform the conversion
    const html = reporter.fromAxeResult(axeResults).asHTML();

    // Output the HTML file for offline viewing in any modern browser
    await util.promisify(fs.writeFile)(
        './test-results/my-accessibility-test.html',
        JSON.stringify(html),
        { encoding: 'utf8' });
}
```
